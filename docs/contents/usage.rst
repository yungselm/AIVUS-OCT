Usage
=====

After installation, the AIVUS-CAA GUI provides the following functionality:

- **Open Data:** Press :kbd:`Ctrl+O` or use the menu to load an IVUS image series in DICOM or NIfTI format. 
- **Navigate Frames:** Use the :kbd:`A` (previous) and :kbd:`D` (next) keys to move frame-by-frame. If gating is enabled, use :kbd:`W`/ :kbd:`S` to move between diastolic and systolic frames.
- **Draw Contours:** Click on the IVUS image to add draggable control points on the lumen wall. Press :kbd:`Enter` to finalize the contour. The lumen area and perimeter are updated in real-time.
- **Gating:** If enabled, the application will automatically segment the signal to identify cardiac cycles. The user can also manually tag frames as systolic or diastolic.
- **Measurements:** Use the tools to draw up to two distance lines per frame. These distances (e.g. stent length) are recorded in the report.
- **Saving:** Contours, tags, and measurements are auto-saved by default. You can also manually save the session via the `Save` button.
- **Export:** Save the current segmentation as a NIfTI file, or export measured values to CSV for further analysis.

Refer to the interactive help within the GUI for additional shortcuts and tips.
